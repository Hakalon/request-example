# Request-example

This is a simple project for request & request-promise-native.

Before start, you should know that request is the basic module for sending http request.

And there are three different modules for extending Promise to request.

* [request-promise](https://github.com/request/request-promise)
* [request-promise-native](https://github.com/request/request-promise-native)
* [request-promise-any](https://github.com/request/request-promise-any)

In this project, I will use request-promise-native.
